database/migrations/2023_10_09_190939_create_departments_table.php @line 18

- soft delete laravel (have in mind that also in the respective model Department is added a trait softDelete)

*CAREFUL - when going to update page of an employee, the existing photo of the employee is shown but its not in input field


Be careful for the reason why at routes/web.php@line 22 the 'as' => 'admin' is added (it is to give name to the resource as admin.employees.index)

look how model binding works in laravel (its used on the controllers)

app/Models/Department @ scopeFilter ->  https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#local-scopes
